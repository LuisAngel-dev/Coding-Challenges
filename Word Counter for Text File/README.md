## Problem Description

The goal of this technical test is to develop a Python program that reads a text file and counts the number of words it contains. Punctuation marks should not be considered as part of the words.

## Example

The following is an example of a text file:

```
Here is an example of a text file.
The file has several phrases, some short and others longer.
```

## Input

The program should receive as input a text file that is located in the same location as the Python file. The file can contain any number of words and phrases, and may include punctuation marks such as commas, periods, question marks, and exclamation points.

## Output

The program should print to the screen the number of words found in the text file. The output should be a single line that includes the number of words and a brief description, as in the following example:

```
The file has 18 words.
```

## Evaluation Criteria

The technical test will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

* Functionality: the program should count the number of words in the text file correctly and accurately.
* Clarity and organization of code: the code should be structured in a clear and organized manner, with comments explaining the most important parts of the program.
* Efficiency: the program should be efficient and not consume too many system resources.
* Error handling: the program should be able to handle errors properly, for example, when the text file does not exist or cannot be read.

## Delivery

The program should be delivered in a Python file named "word_counter.py". The file should include comments explaining how the program works and how to run it. Additionally, an example text file named "example.txt" should be included to test the program.
